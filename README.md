# Raid-Parser
This project is an adaptation of https://github.com/mikailsheikh/cogitolearning-examples/tree/master/CogPar 
to provide a parser and associated date structure to deal with raid arrays and calculate raid characteristics
based in the members of the raids, which may themselves be raid arrays or simple drive descriptions.
The grammar used is contained as a comment at the start of the parser code
